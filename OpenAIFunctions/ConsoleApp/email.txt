I am writing to request service on my HVAC system, as I have noticed that it is not functioning properly.
The system appears to be blowing cool air instead of warm air, and the airflow also seems to be weaker than usual.
I would appreciate it if you could send a technician to my home to inspect and repair the system as soon as possible.
Please let me know what dates and times are available for an appointment, and any other information I need to know before the appointment.
As for the manufacturer and model number of my HVAC system, I have a preference for Carrier products.
The specific model number of my unit is Carrier Infinity 21 Air Conditioner and Gas Furnace System.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Rodrigo
